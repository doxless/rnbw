# How to run.

Personally I run it through Visual Studio Code, I am not an avid scripter so I do not know how to make it an executable file. Hopefully the next itteration will be more automated.

But basically, open index.js in VSC, open the terminal, and type in "node ."

This will run the file and activate the bot.

# Other.

Enjoy.
